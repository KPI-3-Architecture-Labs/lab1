# lab1

## Simple HTTP Server in Go

This is a basic Go language program that creates an HTTP server to display the current time in JSON format.

### Usage:

1. Make sure you have Go installed and set up. If not, you can follow the instructions [here](https://go.dev/doc/install).
2. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KPI-3-Architecture-Labs/lab1.git
   ```
3. Navigate to the directory:
   ```bash
   cd lab1
   ```
4. Run the program:
   ```bash
   go run .
   ```

### Note:

- This server will only display the current time when accessed at the "/time" endpoint.
